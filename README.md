# Salary Prediction Model

This project presents a salary prediction model tailored for software developers. Leveraging Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit, I developed a user-friendly web application capable of providing real-time salary estimates. The model stands out due to its high accuracy and robustness in handling diverse data inputs, making it a valuable tool for both developers and employers in the tech industry.



## Key Features
Advanced Data Preprocessing: Utilized techniques like Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding to refine the dataset. This crucial step improved the model's accuracy by an impressive 57%, ensuring that it performs reliably across various data scenarios.


## Technologies Used
Python: The backbone of the project, used for developing the core algorithm and data processing routines.

scikit-learn: Used for its powerful machine learning libraries, which were instrumental in building and optimizing The prediction model.

Streamlit: Chosen for its effectiveness in turning data scripts into shareable web apps, which created an accessible platform for users to receive salary estimates.
